# Mk.gee - Alesis

### [Verse 1]

#### **I'm in another body who's in somebody else**
#### Both of the headless and heartless
#### Dancing with themselves, oh yeah
#### **You're not a poet, you're a liar**
#### **I'm not a liar I'm just high**
#### Why both me who's caught inside
#### Two people I don't even like? Uh-huh

### [Chorus]

#### **Why me? Or better, why you?**
#### When we can fake it like any way we want to
#### **Why bleed when we don't have to?**
#### Yeah, just shut your mouth, I only really want you
#### **Are you holding on? Don't you wanna get a move on?**
#### Escapism so easily when we don't havе the money to be
#### Hеalthily getting outta here
##### Woah, don't you wanna get a move on?

### [Verse 2]

#### I'm in another body
#### Who's in somebody else
#### While you're turning over the whole apartment
#### Looking for something else

### [Bridge]

#### *Did you find it? Did you find it?*
#### *Leave it to me to kick the door, uh-huh*
#### *Did you find it? Oh, did you find it?*
#### *Oh, are you free tonight? 'Cause I think I found it*

### [Chorus]
#### **Why me? Or better, why you?**
#### When we can fake it like any way we want to
#### **Why bleed when we don't have to?**
#### Yeah, just shut your mouth, I only really want you
#### **Are you holding on? Don't you wanna get a move on?**
#### Escapism so easily when we don't have the money to be
#### Healthily getting outta here
#### **Woah, don't you wanna get a move on?**

### [Outro]
#### *Baby, don't you wanna get a move on? Oh-oh*
#### *'Cause I do, yes, I*
#### Don't you wanna get a move on? Oh
#### *'Cause I do, I*
#### *Yes, we can find a way, we can find a way*
